    <h1>Gangineni Venkata Niharika Chowdary</h1>
    <h6>HYACINTH HALVEY   _Lady Augusta Gregory_</h6>

    <h6>MR. QUIRKE.</h6> <p>[_Gloomily._]</p><p>Sometimes they will, and more times they will
    not.</p>
    <h6>MISS JOYCE.</h6> <p>And where will you be finding a lodging, Mr. Halvey?</p>
    
   <h6>HYACINTH.</h6> <p>I was going to ask that myself, ma'am. I don't know the town.</p>
    
    <h6>MISS JOYCE.</h6> <p>I know of a good lodging, but it is only a very good man
    would be taken into it.</p>
    
    <h6>MRS. DELANE.</h6> <p>Sure there could be no objection there to Mr. Halvey. There
    is no appearance on him but what is good, and the sergeant after taking
    him up the way he is doing.</p>
    
    <h6>MISS JOYCE.</h6> <p>You will be near to the sergeant in the lodging I speak of.
    The house is convenient to the barracks.</p>
    
    <h6>HYACINTH.</h6> <p>[_Doubtfully._] </p><p>To the barracks?</p>
