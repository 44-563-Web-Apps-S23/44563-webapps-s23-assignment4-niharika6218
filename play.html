    <h1>Gangineni Venkata Niharika Chowdary</h1>
    <h6>HYACINTH HALVEY   _Lady Augusta Gregory_</h6>

    <p>SCENE: _Outside the post-office at the little town of Cloon._ MRS.
     DELANE _at post-office door_. MR. QUIRKE _sitting on a chair at
     butcher's door. A dead sheep hanging beside it, and a thrush in a
     cage above._ FARDY FARRELL _playing on a mouth-organ. Train-whistle
     heard._</p>


<p>MRS. DELANE. There is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.</p>

<p>p>MR. QUIRKE. Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising? It
makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the night-time.
Going about the country, looking for little stags of sheep, striving to
knock a few shillings together. That contract for the soldiers gives me
a great deal to attend to.</p>

<p>MRS. DELANE. I suppose so. It's hard enough on myself to be down ready
for the mail-car in the morning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
often I haven't time to look who are the letters from--or the cards.</p>

<p>MR. QUIRKE. It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
knocking about. If you did not have information of what is going on, who
should have it? Was it you, ma'am, was telling me that the new
sub-sanitary inspector would be arriving to-day?</p>

<p>MRS. DELANE. To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that
train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.</p>

<p>MR. QUIRKE. A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.

MRS. DELANE. So he is, one Hyacinth Halvey; and indeed if all that is
said of him is true, or if a quarter of it is true, he will be a credit
to this town.</p>
